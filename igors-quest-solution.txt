Solution by Garry Francis
----------------------------------------
This is a minimal solution. The game relies extensively on word play, particularly homonyms, homophones and synonyms. Make sure you EXAMINE everything, even adjectives and room descriptions, as there are many hints and puns tucked away in the most unlikely places.

The solution includes a lot of optional commands in brackets. These are included to indicate the clues that lead to the solution. These can be omitted once you know what to do. This is just a small sample of the optional commands. There are many more, as well as more locations and more objects.

Scores are shown in brackets as +A=B, where A is points earned and B is cumulative points earned. There are 9 body parts. You are awarded 5 points for finding a body part and a further 5 points for returning it to the laboratory, i.e. (5 + 5) x 9 = 90 points.
