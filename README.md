# Igor's Quest

By Garry Francis

## Background

One day, Igor is minding his own business in the living room of Doctor Frankenstein's castle, when the doctor comes running down the stairs from his laboratory. He is clearly excited.

"Igor! I've done it! The machine is ready and there's a thunderstorm due tonight. I need fresh body parts: head, hair, eyes, ears, body, arms, hands, legs and feet. You know what to do. Bring the parts to the laboratory. Pronto!"

"Yes, master."

The doctor then adjourns to his study.

This is a traditional text adventure that was originally written for the [Adventuron Treasure Hunt Jam](https://itch.io/jam/treasure-hunt), 6 February to 5 March 2020. The game can be played at [Igor's Quest](https://warrigal.itch.io/igors-quest).
